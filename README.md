# WOW.js [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/matthieua/WOW.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/matthieua/WOW)

Reveal CSS animation as you scroll down a page.
By default, you can use it to trigger [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) animations.
But you can easily change the settings to your favorite animation library.

Advantages:
- Smaller than other JavaScript parallax plugins, like Scrollorama (they do fantastic things, but can be too heavy for simple needs)
- Super simple to install, and works with animate.css, so if you already use it, that will be very fast to setup
- Fast execution and lightweight code: the browser will like it ;-)
- You can change the settings - [see below](#advanced-usage)

## Documentation

[Read the documentation ➫](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/docs.html)

### Dependencies
- [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)

### Installation

- Bower

```bash
   bower install wowjs
```

- NPM

```bash
   npm install wowjs
```

### Basic usage
In order to hide all elements when they are supposed to be hidden. (Anti Flickering)
- CSS

```css
   .wow {
     visibility: hidden;
   }
```

- HTML

```html
  <section class="wow slideInLeft"></section>
  <section class="wow slideInRight"></section>
```

- JavaScript

```javascript
new WOW().init();
```

### Advanced usage

- HTML

```html
  <section class="wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="5s"></section>
  <section class="wow slideInRight" data-wow-offset="10"  data-wow-iteration="10"></section>
```

- JavaScript

```javascript
var wow = new WOW(
  {
    boxClass:     'wow',      // animated element css class (default is wow)
    animateClass: 'animated', // animation css class (default is animated)
    offset:       0,          // distance to the element when triggering the animation (default is 0)
    mobile:       true,       // trigger animations on mobile devices (default is true)
    live:         true,       // act on asynchronously loaded content (default is true)
    callback:     function(box) {
      // the callback is fired every time an animation is started
      // the argument that is passed in is the DOM node being animated
    },
    scrollContainer: null // optional scroll container selector, otherwise use window
  }
);
wow.init();
```

### Asynchronous content support

In IE 10+, Chrome 18+ and Firefox 14+, animations will be automatically
triggered for any DOM nodes you add after calling `wow.init()`. If you do not
like that, you can disable this by setting `live` to `false`.

If you want to support older browsers (e.g. IE9+), as a fallback, you can call
the `wow.sync()` method after you have added new DOM elements to animate (but
`live` should still be set to `true`). Calling `wow.sync()` has no side
effects.
